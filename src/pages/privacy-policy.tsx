          During its operation, the Data Controller handles personal data for several
          purposes, while respecting the rights of the data subjects and fulfilling
          legal obligations. The Data Controller also considers it important to
          present to the data subject the handling and the most important
          characteristics of the personal data that came to the controller’s
          knowledge during the data processing activities.

        <Text>
          What is the legal basis of processing the data subjects’ personal data?
          Personal data is only processed for a specific purpose and on an
          appropriate legal basis. These purposes and legal bases are presented
          individually, in relation to specific data processing.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          What external assistance is used to process your personal data? Personal
          data is mostly processed by the Data Controller at own premises. However,
          there are operations for which a data processor’s external help is
          necessary. The data processor may change according to the characteristics
          of each data processing.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Who is processing your personal data? The data subject may receive
          information about the data processors employed by the Data Controller and
          their contact details in section II of this privacy notice.

          2. Data processing based on the data subject’s consent
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          2.1. Where the Company intends to carry out data processing based on
          consent, the data subject's consent to the processing of his or her
          personal data shall be obtained by means of the data request form and
          information as set out in the Data Processing Policy.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          2.2. Consent shall also be deemed to be given if the data subject ticks a
          box when viewing the Company's website, makes the relevant technical
          settings when using information society services, or makes any other
          statement or takes any other action which clearly indicates the data
          subject's consent to the intended processing of his or her personal data in
          the relevant context. Silence, ticking a box or inaction therefore does not
          constitute consent. The continuation of a telephone call after having been
          duly informed shall constitute consent.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          2.3. Consent covers all processing activities carried out for the same
          purpose or purposes. Where processing is carried out for more than one
          purpose, consent shall be given for all the purposes for which the
          processing is carried out.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          2.4. Where the data subject gives his or her consent in the context of a
          written statement which also relates to other matters, such as the
          conclusion of a sales or service contract, the request for consent must be
          presented in a manner clearly distinguishable from those other matters, in
          a clear and easily accessible form, in clear and plain language. Any part
          of such a statement containing the consent of the data subject which is in
          breach of the Regulation shall not be binding.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          2.5. The Company shall not make the conclusion or performance of a contract
          conditional on the giving of consent to the processing of personal data
          which are not necessary for the performance of the contract.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          2.6. The data subject may withdraw his/her consent at any time by sending
          an e-mail to the e-mail address indicated in Chapter I.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          2.7. If the data subject withdraws his/her consent, the controller may no
          longer process his/her data. Where consent is withdrawn, the controller
          must ensure that the data are erased, unless another legal basis allows for
          the processing of those data (e.g. storage requirements or the need to
          perform a contract). Where processing has been carried out for more than
          one purpose, the controller may not use the personal data for the purpose
          for which the data subject has withdrawn consent.

          2.8. In all the data processing cases indicated below, the data subject
          acknowledges that the provision of data is not a prerequisite for the
          conclusion of a contract and is not obliged to provide his/her personal
          data.

          3.1. In the case of data processing based on performing legal obligations,
          the scope of the data that can be processed, the purpose of the data
          processing, the duration of data storage and the recipients are governed by
          the provisions of the underlying legislation.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          3.2. The processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation
          is based on the regulation, regardless of the consent of the data subject.
          In this case, prior to the processing of the data, the data subject shall
          be informed that the data processing is obligatory and shall be clearly and
          in detail informed of all facts concerning the processing, in particular
          the purpose and legal basis of the data processing, the person authorized
          to handle and process the data, the duration of the data processing,
          whether the personal data of the data subject are processed by the Data
          Controller on the basis of the legal obligation applicable to him or her,
          and who can get access to the data. The information shall include the
          rights and remedies available to the data subject. In the case of mandatory
          data processing, the information may also take place with the publication
          of a reference to the legislative provisions which contain the foregoing
          information.
        </Text>

        <Heading as="h4">4. Data processing based on legitimate interests</Heading>
        <Text>
          4.1. The legitimate interests of the Company or a third party may provide a
          legal basis for the processing, provided that the interests, fundamental
          rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail. The reasonable
          expectations of the data subject based on his or her relationship with the
          controller should be taken into account, so that the processing of personal
          data for contact purposes, even for direct marketing purposes, may be
          considered to be based on legitimate interests.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          4.2. The processing based on legitimate interests requires a balancing of
          interest test, in which the Company will always take into account the
          current circumstances and the situation of the controller and the data
          subjects. In the case of processing in the interest of the Company, the
          balancing of interests tests carried out separately have led to the
          following result: in the balancing of interests test, the Company has
          concluded, taking into account the conditions described for the processing
          in question, that the processing is justified subject to the appropriate
          safeguards, as set out in this Policy, without which the Company would not
          be able to operate competitively. In this light, the emotional impact on
          data subjects and the harm to their right to privacy can be considered
          proportionate.

          subject or other natural person
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          5.1. The protection of the vital interests of the data subject or of
          another natural person may also provide a legal basis for processing, given
          that the right to data protection is fundamental but not exclusive, and
          that the right to the protection of personal data is naturally overridden
          by the right to life in a life and death context.

        <Heading as="h4">6. Data processing based on contractual interests</Heading>
        <Text>
          6.1. Data processing may also be based on a contractual interest if it is
          necessary for the performance of a contract in which the data subject is a
          party or if it is requested by the data subject in order to prepare the
          contract.

          (1) The Company provides an open access control system for communities
          based on blockchain. Roles are defined by blockchain assets (tokens, NFTs).
          Rewards (e.g. accessing special chat rooms, or GitHub repositories) are
          provided the same way.

          The natural person using the website (you, the user) can give his/her

          box.

          (3) Using the website and participating in our services related to the
          creation and management of decentralized autonomous organizations ("DAO")
          we use smart contracts that necessarily collect information such as your
          cryptocurrency wallet public address (which some jurisdictions may consider
          personal information) and store that information on a{" "}
          <b>public blockchain</b>, which is not controlled by us. In addition,
          knowing your wallet public address means that the transaction history is
          visible due to the nature of the technology used. A <b>smart contract</b>{" "}
          is computer code that automatically processes events when certain
          conditions are met; for example, when a proposal is submitted to a member's
          DAO, and after that DAO member casts all the necessary votes, the smart
          contract executes the proposed action if the proposal passes. In these
          situations, your personal information is stored on the respective
          blockchain through the execution of the smart contract and cannot
          necessarily be modified or deleted due to the immutable nature of the
          blockchain.{" "}

          purpose, Twitter also requests, stores and processes personal data. The
          Controller has no control over the type, scope and processing of these data
          and does not receive personal data from the Twitter operator. On Twitter
          pages, the Data Controller processes the personal data of followers on the
          basis of the voluntary consent of the followers, which is deemed to have
          been given by the fact that the person concerned likes, follows or comments
          on the page or posts. The data subject declares that he/she is over 16
          years of age when requesting services on the Twitter page of the
          Controller. A person under the age of 16 requires the consent of his or her
          legal representative in order for his or her declaration of consent to the
          processing to be valid pursuant to Article 8(1) of the GDPR. The controller
          is not in a position to verify the age and entitlement of the person giving
          consent, so the data subject warrants that the data he or she has provided
          is accurate.

          (3) Purpose of processing: to provide information on current information,
          news concerning the Data Controller, advertising on social media,
          presentation and promotion of services. The Twitter page is used by the
          Data Controller for marketing purposes in order to inform interested
          parties about its services and to enable them to contact the Data
          Controller.

          prerequisite for the conclusion of a contract and is not obliged to provide
          his/her personal data. The possible consequence of not providing the data
          is the failure to inform the Data Controller about current news and
          services concerning the Data Controller.
